# Bitmap Gallery Builder

The Bitmap Gallery Builder was created to empower users to build highly customized, interactive online portfolios or "linktree-style" pages without writing a single line of code. It bridges the gap between powerful design tools and simple website builders by offering a flexible, canvas-based editing experience with a focus on a simple, powerful final output.

The entire application runs in a single HTML file, and the final export is a self-contained static website, making it incredibly easy to host on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
